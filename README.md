# MusicalFunctions-TurboC
Small program to test how different functions can affect frequencies, creating interesting sounds. The file does require a turboC compilier to run since it uses the sound() function from <dos.h>. I tested it through dos box but I edited the file outside in notepad++. Not sure if theres a better way but wanted to try out dos box.
